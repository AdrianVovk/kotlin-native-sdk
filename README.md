# Substance SDK
The Substance SDK is a set of tooling and libraries that are designed for simplified multi-platform development

## Gradle Plugin
The Gradle Plugin for compilation of SDK Projects can be found at [gradle-plugin/](gradle-plugin/README.md)

## Library
The SDK Library is a multiplatform library for providing shared APIs between platforms. It can be found at [sdk/](sdk/README.md). **COMING SOON**

## KIDE Plugin
The plugin for providing build support for the KIDE can be found at [kide-plugin/](kide-plugin/README.md). **COMING SOON**

## Samples
You can currently find two samples for the Substance SDK. The full UI sample found at [sample/](sample/README.md), and a more multiplatform sample at [simple-sample/](simple-sample/README.md)

Eventually, these two samples will be merged together and will show off all of the features of the SDK Library and Gradle Plugin.

## Scripts
The scripts folder contains a gradle wrapper installation. If you do not have a standalone gradle installation, use `scripts/gradlew`
