# Gradle Plugin
This project is a gradle plugin for using the Substance SDK. This will eventually allow for a codebase that works on multiple platforms and targets.

### Build file configuration:
##### `settings.gradle`
Configure the `settings.gradle` file like so:
```groovy
// Let the compiler find Kotlin-Native
pluginManagement.repositories {
	maven {
		url 'https://dl.bintray.com/jetbrains/kotlin-native-dependencies/'
	}
	gradlePluginPortal()
}

// Include build types
include("native")
include("jvm")
include("android")
```
The first block gives Gradle the ability to find [Kotlin/Native](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native)

The `include` statements enable configurations for the plugin. In other words, `include("native")` enables compilation for native targets, `include("jvm")` enables compilation for the JVM, etc. (See note 1)

Here is an example `build.gradle.kts` file:
```kotlin
plugins {
	id("substance.SdkPlugin") version "0.0.0"
}

sdk {
	appName = "My App" // Name of the application
	appId = "com.example.app" // ID of the application

	debug = false // Tell the program to print out debug detail. DEFAULT: true
	suppressPlatformWarning = true // Suppress the warning about excluded build platforms. DEFAULT: false
	modifyTasksReport = false // Allow this plugin to modify the ':tasks' task (See note 2). DEFAULT: true

	inputDir = "sources/" // Currently adds one extra directory to compilation
	outputDir = "customOut/" // Where to place binaries. DEFAULT: "out/"

	windows {
		"windows.Main" {
			main()
		}
		"windows.Details"()
		"windows.About"()
	}

	native {
		interop("name", defFile = "path/to/def/file.def", pkg = "interop.name") // Include a def file as interop
		interop("another", defFile = "path/to/another/file.def", pkg = "interop.another") // Can be run many times
		interop("generatedDef", pkg = "interop.generated") {
			headers("header1.h", "header2.h", "header3.h")

			compilerOpts = "-I. -I/usr/include/something"
			// or use compilerOpts("-I.", "-I/usr/include/something")

			// this C code is included in the bindings
			includeC = """
				static inline int getErrno() {
				    return errno;
				}
			"""

			headerFilter = "SomeLibrary/**"
			excludeDependentModules = true
		}

		linkerOpts = "" // Pass linker opts to Konan compiler
		optimize = false // Make binaries smaller at the expense of compile time. DEFAULT: true

		configure {
			// Configure the build file directly

			dependencies {
				compile("foo.bar.bas:Asdf:1.0.0")
			}
		}
	}

	jvm.main = "MainKt" // The main class to run for Java. DEFAULT: Is to be located in the SDK library. Set this manually for now
	jvm.configure {
		// Configure the build file directly

		dependencies {
			compile("foo.bar.bas:Asdf:1.0.0")
		}
	}

	android {
		compileSdkVersion = 26 // REQUIRED if the Android target is enabled. Acts the same as it does in the default Android gradle plugin
		buildToolsVersion = "26.0.0" // REQUIRED if the Android target is enabled. Acts the same as it does in the default Android gradle plugin

		androidConfigure {
			// This is the same as the `android` configuration block in the standard Android plugin
		}

		configure {
			// Configure the build file directly
		}

		useKotlinExtensions = false // Enables or disables the Android Kotlin Extensions library. DEFAULT: true
		downloadSdk = true // Downloads the Android SDK if necessary. DEFAULT: false
	}
}
```

### Project structure
The SDK plugin has a custom project structure for the multi-language build process.

This is the default directory structure:

- `Project root`
	- `build.gradle.kts`: The build script for configuring the build
	- `src/`: The main source directory
		- `shared/`: Contains files to be compiled by all builds.
		- `native/`: Contains files to be compiled by Kotlin/Native.
		- `jvm/`: Contains files to be compiled by Kotlin/JVM.
		- `jvm-ext/`: Contains extra files for the JVM
			- `java/`: Contains Java source files to be compiled
			- `resources/`: Contains resource files to be compiled
		- `android/`: Contains files to be compiled for Android
		- `android-ext/`: Contains extra files for Android
			- `AndroidManifest.xml`: The Android manifest (if it isn't being generated by the build script)
			- `java/`: Contains Java source files to be compiled
			- ~~`ndk/`: Contains Kotlin/Native (or C, depending on configuration) source files to be compiled for the NDK~~
			- `jni/`: Contains source for the JNI
			- `jni-libs/`: Contains libraries for the JNI
			- `res/`: Contains Android resource files to be compiled
			- `resources/`: Contains Java-syle resource files to be compiled
			- `assets/`: Contains assets to be included in the APK
			- `renderscript/`: Contains renderscript scripts to be built
			- `aidl/`: Contains AIDL files to be included in the build
	- `out/`: Where all compiled binaries are placed

### Tasks
##### Building
`buildNative` or `native:build`: Build the program for native targets (using Kotlin/Native)

`buildJvm` or `jvm:build`: Build the program for the JVM

`buildAndroid` or `android:build`: COMING SOON

##### Running
`runNative` or `native:run`: Build, then run the program for native targets (using Kotlin/Native)

`runJvm` or `jvm:run`: Build, then run the program for the JVM

`runAndroid` or `android:run`: COMING SOON

When using the run tasks, it is possible to pass arguments to the program.
To do this, use `-Pargs=""` with your build command and put your arguements in the quotes.

##### Extras
`genMetadata`: Generate a metadata file containing build information for the SDK library (located at `build/sdk/gen/metadata.kt`)

`native:genDefs`: Generate def files for native interop (located at `build/sdk/nativeDefs/`)

`native:genManifest`: Generate the Android manifest (located at `build/sdk/android/AndroidManifest.xml`)

### Extra notes
1: This project sandboxes all of its tasks to seperate subprojects. This fixes conflicts while still providing a way for the developer to access the tasks necessary.
This causes the side-effect of the 'platform syntax' (`platform:task`).

2: This plugin modifies the output of the `:tasks` task to *not* include subprojects. This fixes an issue where the sandboxing (See note 1) made the output messy.
By default, if you are only running one of the platforms, this acts as if there is no sandbox and allows the tasks to show up in the root,
but if you have multiple platforms enabled, this removes them (and only them) from the output. With this setup, any other subprojects will behave as expected.
